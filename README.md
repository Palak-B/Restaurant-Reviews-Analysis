# Restaurant-Reviews-Analysis

Our project utilizes the datasets on businesses, reviews, and users data provided by Yelp3. The business dataset contains information on location, business rating, number of reviews, category, whether the business is operating, operating hours, and additional attributes specific to each of the 150,346 businesses. The reviews dataset contains the rating, review text, date, and the number of other users who find the review useful, funny, or cool of close to 7 million reviews. These datasets will allow us to dive deeper into the relationship between reviews and business popularity as well as their operating status from one of the largest online review and recommendation venues. Motivated by the fact that many small businesses had to close down during COVID, we seek to use customers’ reviews and various business features to understand and predict businesses’ popularity, quality, and status of operation. This information will provide insights to both the customers and the business owners as they navigate through the pandemic recovery.
